Based on `MuColl_v1` moving the solenoid after the tracker, making calorimeters thicker and adding a muon system.
Each version of nozzle is labeled by surface depth of W.
Ranging from 1cm - 10cm
Blackhole volume fills in the rest of the nozzle, aside from the beampipe
The blackhole volume has a tracking limit of 0.01mm
The original files can be found in /simulation/geometries/MuColl_10TeV_v0A
"blackhole" nozzle and MuColl file has same tracking limit applied to original nozzle geometry.
